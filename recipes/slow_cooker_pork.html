    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque sauce that's easy to make in the slow cooker. 
       I like to serve the shredded pork on toasted buttered rolls. My family's favorite!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
